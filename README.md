## Golf Statistics Data Science Project
- ### This is a project that explores the relationship between golf statistics and wins. The goal is to identify which golf statistic has the highest correlation with wins, using data from the PGA Tour 2017.

## Data
- ### The data for this project is obtained from kaggle at the url listed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grantruedy/pga-tour-golf-data-2017-season?select=PGATOUR_data2.csv It shows various golf statistics for a number of players

## This project uses Python 3 and requires the following dependencies:

- pandas
- matplotlib

## Data preparation: Load the data into a pandas DataFrame and clean it up, including removing missing values and irrelevant columns.
- ### Data exploration: Explore the relationship between each golf statistic and wins using scatter plots and correlation coefficients.
- ### Correlation analysis: use the correlation function to analyze various golf statistics 
## Results
- ### The analysis revealed 

## How to Run
- ### To run this project, you can open the Data_Project.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, and run the code cells in order. You will need to have the dependencies listed above installed.

## Conclusion
- ### This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be used to analyze the relationship between golf statistics and metrics. Using the matrix at the end can draw conclusions around the data.
